Delete all the App.js and related file.

Start from Card.js
 then create CardList by taking props for Card from Robots.js

 Now, Above was basic.
 Create App.js
 Move <CreateList /> from index.js and move inside App.js
Remember : App.js should not take nay props. so any thing required in CreateList should beimported in App.js
App.js is parent of all the childs.

index.js -> root of index.html is replaced by what  is in App.js
